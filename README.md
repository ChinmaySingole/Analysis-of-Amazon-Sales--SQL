# Amazon Sales Analysis Using SQL Queries

## Problem Description 
Amazon, one of the largest e-commerce platforms globally, provides a vast array of products across categories. Analyzing product sales and customer reviews can help uncover key insights into pricing strategies, product quality, and customer satisfaction. The objective of this project is to analyze Amazon's sales data using SQL queries to answer critical business questions.

## Project Objective
1.List all products with a discounted price below ₹500.

2.Find products with a discount percentage of 50% or more.

3.Retrieve all products where the name contains the word "Cable."

4.Display the difference between the average of the actual price and the discounted price for each product.

5.Query reviews that mention "fast charging" in their content.

6.Identify products with a discount percentage between 20% and 40%.

7.Find products that have an actual price above ₹1,000 and are rated 4 stars or above.

8.Find products where the discounted price ends with a 9.

9.Display review contents that contain words like "worst", "waste", "poor", or "not good."

10.List all products where the category includes "Accessories."

## Tools & Techniques

- Database Language: SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Data Storage: Relational Database

- SQL Environment: MySQL Workbench 
- Documentation: PDF



## Key Insights
- High Discounts (≥50%) were frequently applied to tech accessories, especially cables and chargers.

- Many products priced below ₹500 after discount were also highly rated, indicating value for money.

- The word "Cable" appears commonly in top-selling products, indicating high consumer demand.

- Some reviews with the term "fast charging" correlate with higher customer ratings.

- Negative sentiment reviews (keywords like "worst", "not good") help in identifying products that may need quality checks or delisting.
##  Future Improvements
- Dashboard Integration: Visualize the SQL outputs using Power BI or Tableau.

- Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP to analyze review sentiment more accurately.

- Category Performance: Compare performance across different product categories.

- Time-Series Trends: Add a time dimension to analyze monthly or seasonal trends.

- Customer Segmentation: Integrate user data to understand buyer personas.
